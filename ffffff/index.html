            Sherlock, the game is afoot once more! A cryptic message has landed in your hands, and it points to a critical piece of evidence.
            Hidden within this encrypted file are clues that Moriarty himself has left behind. But be warned, the journey ahead is not for the faint-hearted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside this file, you’ll find logs from a server Moriarty used to plan his sinister schemes. These logs hold the key to your next move,
            but they’re locked away behind a layer of encryption. Your first task is to uncover the password. The shadows of this page hold the answer—inspect them closely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have the password, extract the file and comb through the logs carefully. Somewhere in those lines lies a hidden path that will lead you to the next step in this puzzle.
            Moriarty is always one step ahead, but with your unmatched deduction skills, you can turn the tables.
